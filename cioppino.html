    <p id="para">To make a hearty and flavorful Cioppino, begin by heating a few tablespoons of olive oil in a large, deep pot over medium heat. Saut√© 1 finely chopped onion, 1 diced bell pepper, 2-3 chopped celery stalks, and 3-4 minced garlic cloves until they become soft and fragrant. Add a pinch of red pepper flakes and 1 teaspoon of dried oregano for extra flavor. Pour in 1 cup of dry white wine, allowing it to simmer and reduce by half. Then, add 1 can (28 ounces) of crushed tomatoes or tomato puree, 2 cups of fish stock or seafood broth, and 2-3 bay leaves. Let the mixture simmer for about 30 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Next, add the assorted seafood, such as white fish, shellfish, crab, squid, shrimp, and scallops, along with a handful of torn fresh basil leaves. Simmer for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the seafood is cooked through. Just before serving, squeeze in the juice of 1-2 lemons for brightness. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley. Serve your Cioppino hot with crusty bread to soak up the rich and savory broth. Enjoy this delightful seafood stew!</p>
