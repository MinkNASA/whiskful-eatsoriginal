    <p id="para">To prepare a comforting and flavorful Tomato Soup, start by heating a few tablespoons of olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add 1 finely chopped large onion, 2-3 finely chopped carrots, and 2-3 finely chopped celery stalks. Saut√© the vegetables until they become soft and the onion turns translucent. Stir in 2-3 minced garlic cloves and cook for another minute until fragrant. Add about 2-3 pounds of fresh, ripe tomatoes (peeled and chopped) or canned tomatoes, along with 2 tablespoons of tomato paste, 1-2 teaspoons of sugar, and your preferred fresh or dried herbs like basil and oregano. Pour in approximately 4 cups of vegetable or chicken broth to cover the ingredients. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and let it cook for about 20-30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Remove the pot from the heat and use an immersion blender or regular blender to puree the soup until it's smooth. Return the soup to the pot, add salt and pepper to taste, and optionally, 1/2 cup of heavy cream for a creamy texture. Reheat the soup gently, and it's ready to serve. Enjoy your homemade Tomato Soup with crusty bread or a sprinkle of fresh herbs on top!</p>
