    <p id="para">To make flavorful Zucchini Patties, start by grating 2-3 medium-sized zucchini and placing them in a bowl. Sprinkle some salt over the grated zucchini to draw out excess moisture, and let them sit for about 10-15 minutes. Afterward, use a clean kitchen towel or paper towels to squeeze and drain the zucchini thoroughly. In another bowl, beat 1 large egg and add it to the drained zucchini. Stir in approximately 1/2 to 1 cup of breadcrumbs, 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese, 1-2 cloves of minced garlic, chopped fresh herbs like parsley, dill, or basil for added flavor, and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Mix the ingredients until well combined. Heat a few tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Form the zucchini mixture into patties and carefully place them in the hot skillet. Cook until they are golden brown and crispy on both sides, which typically takes about 3-4 minutes per side. Transfer the cooked Zucchini Patties to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil. Serve your delicious Zucchini Patties as a side dish or appetizer, and enjoy their crispy exterior and savory zucchini goodness!</p>
