    <p id="para">To create a delightful fruitcake, start by preheating your oven to 300°F (150°C) and lining a 9-inch round cake tin with parchment paper. In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of mixed dried fruit (such as raisins, currants, chopped dates, and candied citrus peel), 1/2 cup of chopped nuts (like walnuts or almonds), and 1/2 cup of dark rum or brandy. Let the fruit mixture soak for at least an hour or overnight for the best results, stirring occasionally. In a separate bowl, cream together 1 cup of unsalted butter and 1 cup of granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in 4 large eggs one at a time, and add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. In another bowl, whisk together 2 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing until well combined. Fold in the soaked fruit and nut mixture. Pour the batter into the prepared cake tin and smooth the top. Bake for 2 to 2.5 hours or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the fruitcake to cool in the tin for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Optionally, you can brush the cooled cake with additional rum or brandy for extra flavor. Once cooled and soaked, wrap the fruitcake tightly in plastic wrap and store it in an airtight container. Fruitcakes often taste even better after a few weeks of aging. Enjoy your homemade fruitcake!</p>
