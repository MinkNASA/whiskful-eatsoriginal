    <p id="para">To create a delectable pot of French Onion Soup, begin by melting 4 tablespoons of unsalted butter and a couple of tablespoons of olive oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. Add 4-5 thinly sliced large onions, season with a pinch of salt, and cook slowly over low-medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions turn deeply caramelized and golden brown. This can take about 30-45 minutes. Optionally, sprinkle a pinch of sugar over the onions to aid in caramelization. Once the onions are beautifully caramelized, stir in 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour and cook for a few minutes to remove the raw flour taste. If desired, pour in approximately 1/2 cup of dry white wine, such as white wine or sherry, and let it simmer for a couple of minutes to enhance the flavor. Add about 8 cups of beef broth or beef stock, season with freshly ground black pepper, and let the soup simmer for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. While the soup simmers, toast slices of baguette or French bread until they are crispy and golden. To serve, ladle the soup into oven-safe bowls, top each with a slice of toasted bread, and generously sprinkle grated Gruy√®re cheese over the bread. Place the bowls under the broiler until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown. Serve your classic French Onion Soup piping hot, savoring the rich flavors of caramelized onions and gooey cheese.</p>
