    <p id="para">To craft your own delectable chocolate ice cream at home, begin by whisking together 2 cups of heavy cream, 1 cup of whole milk, 3/4 to 1 cup of granulated sugar, 1/2 to 3/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, and a pinch of salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir until the mixture is well-combined and heated, but do not let it boil. In a separate bowl, whisk 4-6 large egg yolks and then slowly add a portion of the hot cocoa mixture, whisking continuously. This tempers the eggs. Pour the egg-cocoa mixture back into the saucepan and continue heating, stirring constantly until the mixture thickens, coating the back of a spoon. Remove from heat, stir in 1-2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, and let it cool. Once cooled, refrigerate the mixture for several hours or overnight. Then, transfer it to an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions. If desired, add chocolate chips, nuts, or other mix-ins during the last few minutes of churning. Finally, freeze the ice cream until it reaches your desired consistency. Your homemade chocolate ice cream is ready to indulge in!</p>
