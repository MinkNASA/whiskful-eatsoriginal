    <p id="para">To make delicious strawberry cupcakes, start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lining a cupcake tin with paper liners. In a mixing bowl, combine 1 and 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder, and a pinch of salt. In a separate bowl, cream together 1/2 cup of unsalted butter and 1 cup of granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in 2 large eggs and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, alternating with 1/2 cup of strawberry puree (made by blending fresh or frozen strawberries). Fill each cupcake liner about two-thirds full with the batter and bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into a cupcake comes out clean. Allow them to cool completely before frosting. For the frosting, beat 1/2 cup of softened butter with 2 cups of powdered sugar and 1/4 cup of strawberry puree until smooth and fluffy. Pipe or spread the frosting onto the cooled cupcakes, and garnish with sliced strawberries if desired. Enjoy your homemade strawberry cupcakes!</p>
