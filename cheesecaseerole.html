    <p id="para">To create a comforting and cheesy Casserole, begin by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Cook approximately 2 cups of your favorite pasta (macaroni, penne, or rotini work well) according to the package instructions until it's al dente. While the pasta cooks, melt 2-3 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in 2-3 tablespoons of all-purpose flour to create a roux, cooking for a minute or two until it becomes lightly golden. Gradually whisk in about 2 cups of milk until the mixture thickens and becomes smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste. In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked pasta and approximately 2 cups of shredded cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, or your favorite blend). Pour the creamy sauce over the pasta and cheese, stirring to coat everything evenly. Transfer the mixture to a greased casserole dish and sprinkle some additional cheese on top for a golden crust. Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until the casserole is bubbly and the cheese is melted and slightly browned. Serve your warm and gooey Cheese Casserole as a comforting side dish or a satisfying main course. Feel free to customize it with add-ins like vegetables, bacon, or herbs to suit your taste. Enjoy!</p>
