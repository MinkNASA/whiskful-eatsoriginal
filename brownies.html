    <p id="para">To whip up a batch of decadently fudgy brownies, begin by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and greasing a 9x13-inch baking pan. In a saucepan over low heat, melt 1 cup (2 sticks) of unsalted butter. Remove from heat, and stir in 2 cups of granulated sugar until well combined. Beat in 4 large eggs, one at a time, ensuring each is fully incorporated. In a separate bowl, whisk together 1 cup of all-purpose flour, 1 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined. Stir in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Optionally, fold in 1-1.5 cups of chocolate chips, chopped nuts, or your preferred mix-ins. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan, spreading it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for approximately 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Be careful not to overbake; slightly underbaking ensures fudgy brownies. Allow the brownies to cool completely in the pan before cutting them into squares. Enjoy your homemade fudgy brownies!</p>
