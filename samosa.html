    <p id="para">To make a delicious chocolate cake, begin by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and greasing and flouring two 9-inch round cake pans. In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 and 3/4 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 and 3/4 cups of granulated sugar, 3/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder, 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of baking soda, and 1 teaspoon of salt. Add 2 large eggs, 1 cup of buttermilk, 1/2 cup of vegetable oil, and 2 teaspoons of pure vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Mix everything together until the batter is smooth and well combined. Gradually stir in 1 cup of hot water, and be prepared for the batter to become thin – this is normal. Pour the batter evenly into the prepared cake pans and bake for approximately 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in the pans for about 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can frost and decorate your chocolate cake as desired. Enjoy your homemade chocolate cake!</p>
